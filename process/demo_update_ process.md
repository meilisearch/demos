# Demo Update Process

## Overview

Updating a demo to the most recent version causes a number of issues. As a result, the focus of this process is to document all of the steps involved in migrating a demo from an older version of Meilisearch to the most recent version.

## What to do:

1. Clone the Demos repo's main branch to locally work on any upgrade.

> ðŸ™‚ Donâ€™t work on the production repo

2. Create a new branch for each demo that needs to be updated to start making changes locally. As a result, each demo will have its own PR, making the code review process easier.
3. Update the demo and test it locally to ensure everything is working properly.
4. Create a PR and request a developer advocate to review the code changes. Donâ€™t forget to highlight breaking changes in the PR:
    - Meilisearch API routes, as well as functions in the Meilisearch SDK that may have changed;
    - New feature added to the demo if any;
    - Attach the link to the full changelog to be clear about the new feature(s) and the impact on the users.
5. After the code review is approved, merge the PR(s).
6. Follow this [guide](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-migration) to update the corresponding demo server in DigitalOcean. You can find demo droplets and their URLs [here](https://www.notion.so/5de77184bb8e42f8a1baa95dec76ec33) *(private link)*.
7. Because new values for the `Default Search API Key` and `Default Admin API Key` are generated after updating Meilisearch on DigitalOcean:
    - Update breaking changes note with the new `Default Search API Key` value;
    - Update these changes in the code/env file;
    - Communicate the new API keys to the owners of the demo sandboxes.
